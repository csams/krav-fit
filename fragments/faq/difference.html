Krav Maga focuses on the martial and not the art. We train for REAL attacks. There are no forms or katas. We try to simulate the stress of an attack by having students perform as close to real attacks as possible. This places the defender under stressful conditions, which is what you would feel in a real attack. Therefore, when you learn and train a self-defense technique under stress, with full adrenaline and heart pounding, you will be prepared to use those techniques in a real life situation, where the stress, adrenaline, and fear levels are high.
