Krav Maga (pronounced krahv magah) is not a traditional martial art. It was developed in an environment where the Israeli military could not devote many hours to hand to hand combat training. Therefore, the Krav Maga system was created to bring students to a high level of skill in a relatively short period of time. There are no forms (katas) or rules or set combinations as reactions to attacks. Instead, Krav Maga training focuses on teaching simple self-defense techniques which specifically cater to reality based attack situations. The art of Krav Maga deals more with personal safety issues and is considered to be a modern, highly refined,self-defense system, designed to be used against armed and unarmed attackers. <br /> <br />Krav Maga is comprised of two main parts: combatives and self defense. With combatives, you learn how to neutralize an opponent quickly and effectivly. It embodies elements related to the actual performance of the fight including tactics, feints, powerful combinations of different attacks, the psychological dimensions of the fight, and learning how to use the environment to your advantage. Different types of combatives used in Krav Maga including punches, kicks, eye gouges, elbows, knees, headbutts, biting, etc. <br /> <br /> Students apply the relevant Krav Maga principles and techniques in a multitude of situations, even in unfamiliar or adverse circumstances, such under extreme stress and/or fatigue. Krav Maga includes specialized training methods that not only challenge students physically, but also instill a special, mental discipline meant to strengthen the spirit and to develop the ability to deal with violent confrontations under intense stress. In fact, the techniques taught in our classes also incorporate the self-defense techniques taught to law enforcement personnel.
